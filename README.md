This is a simple app I made to find who is located close to me, based on my friend's Current City on Facebook. Its basic functionality is similar to [Connect](http://connect.com/).

# To install
1. Open InfoPlist.strings and put in your own facebook id (please don't use the one that is there). You can get this at on the [Facebook Developer portal](http://developer.facebook.com).
1. Run `bundle install` to setup Cocoapods (only the first time).
1. Run `pod install` to install the necessary Cocoapods.
1. Build and run!

# Todo
1. Check location stamps in checkins, posts.
1. Expand to Foursquare, Twitter, etc.
